# Development

---
Week 1: integrated cinderblocks for the game into my project

- Struggled with linking box2d and sql database
- main problems faced were with some box2d files not being linked properly


Week 2: created backend code, along with basic user interface

- created class objects like, ship, location, game board, and game engine
- worked on writing the program for adding ships for a player and attacking the opponent's ships
- layed out the basic user interface required to play the game
- Struggled with creating the game board, and corresponding the board locations to that of the window
- worked out the ship display for both players


Week 3: completed the front end and backend of the code, thus making the game operational

- created the layout for attacking opponent ships
- created game logic to play a competitive round
- worked on displaying the missiles of players
- worked out a method to identify the correct location attacked (i.e. opponent ships' locations)
- setup the database to keep track of player scores
- made game display presentable
