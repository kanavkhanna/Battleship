I plan on creating the famous Battleship game.

I have always loved to play Battleship, and it has often been my go-to entertainment source on flights, which is why I would like to create my own version of it.

Along with the built-in libraries in C++ like the random library and STL (for vectors and maps), I will also implement the Cinder library, i.e. Cinder Blocks, chiefly Render GL.

Timeline:

Week 1: Setting up and integrating the libraries into the project, implement basic backend
Week 2: Make advancements on backend, and start working on the UI
Week 3: Complete the game.
In case I am able to finish my work before the deadline, I will try improving the front end of the game, to make it look more advanced.
